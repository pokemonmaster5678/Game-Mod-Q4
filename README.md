I would mod Quake 4 to Pokemon RPG alike how it works. 
The monster will spawn and the turn base will begin when the monster approach. 
Whether you defeat or capture the monsters with poke ball, it will gain experience by leveling up. 
Players will heal or reloading bullet by using the items when taking turns.
